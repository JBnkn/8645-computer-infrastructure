# 8645-computer-infrastructure
**by Joseph Benkanoun**

Repository for the 2024 [Computer Infrastructure](https://www.gmit.ie/computer-infrastructure) module as part of the [Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics](https://www.gmit.ie/higher-diploma-in-science-in-computing-in-data-analytics) at ATU. The assessment of this module comprised of two components:

- the tasks
- the project

An outline of the tasks and how I approached them can be found in my Jupyter Notebook [weather.ipynb](https://github.com/JBnkn/8645-computer-infrastructure/blob/main/weather.ipynb).

The project component can be found within my <code>.github/workflows</code> folder.
